JSONViewer AI is built to simplify how people work with JSON data.

Instead of manually reading raw JSON strings, users can paste their data and instantly see a structured, readable view that is easy to explore.

## What problems does it solve?

- Hard-to-read JSON responses  
- Debugging API payloads  
- Understanding deeply nested data  
- Identifying invalid JSON  

## How JSONViewer AI works

1. Paste JSON into the editor  
2. The tool formats and validates the data automatically  
3. Errors are highlighted clearly  
4. Objects and arrays can be expanded or collapsed
